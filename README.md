# CIS 127 Code
This is a repo to showcase my Computer Information Systems, Course Number 127, source code. GRCC C++ II Projects.

The last quarter of this course was taught online due to COVID-19
Big thanks to Professor Carmon. 

You will find the assignments I completed throughout the CIS 127 class here.
I didn't attach or add what the goal was for each assignment. This is simply just to show the work I've done.


## Assignments 0-4
These are commandline/terminal applications that do what a Hangman game would do.

## Hangman_About is a QT Project
In this course I learned QT. It's not pretty but it works. I wish I had more time but COVID-19 made my other classes more difficult and time crunches started to inhibit the amount of tinker time I would have had with QT. I really just had to do what was required, and then a little bit more to tidy stuff up.

The blank space in the middle was for the hangman stuff, but like I said, I ran out of time. 

* Had to implement the Hangman code that we wrote into QT.

## Review old code.docx
I am going to leave this here. We were asked two questions about commentning code. I like knowing what my train of thought was back then. I beilieve that I have progressed as a coder. This is proof. It's kinda hypcritlical, but that just shows you i've changed.
